                      The GDPR provides several situations upon which Lykluk can
                      rely for Processing Personal Data, namely consent,
                      contractual necessity, compliance with a legal obligation,
                      vital interests of data subjects, public interest or
                      legitimate interest. Similarly, applicable laws may
                      provide for equivalent or additional legal grounds, as
                      explained further below in the country specific paragraphs
                      under Section 8.

                      oppose to such Processing (unless the applicable laws

                      further explained herein. However, this may limit your
                      ability to take full advantage of the many features we
                      offer and, consequently, deteriorate your user experience.
                      Furthermore, Lykluk Service offers to Visitors access to a
                      multitude of videos without charging a corresponding fee.
                      This is possible only by associating advertisements to the
                      available videos. Content and ads are both integral parts
                      of our Service and the Lykluk Service cannot exist without
                      either of them. Not consenting to Processing of your Data
                      will not eliminate or limit the number of ads you are
                      shown; it may simply result in ads which are more
                      repetitive and likely less interesting to you.

                      We may use or work with third parties, including our
                      Commercial Partners and service providers, who use mobile
                      SDKs to collect information such as advertising
                      identifiers (e.g., &ldquo;ad-ID&rdquo; or

                      devices interact with the Lykluk Service. An SDK is
                      computer code that app developers can include in their
                      apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected and
                      related services and functionality to be implemented (a
                      mobile SDK is a mobile app version of a pixel tag or
                      beacon, described above). For instance, we may use this
                      technology to analyze how you interact with Content and
                      advertisements and to enable analytics or other features
